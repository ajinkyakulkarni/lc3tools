12 February 2004 (version 0.9)
	fixed processing of hex input without leading "x" in lc3convert
	eliminated warnings for use of strlen as field width when
		disassembling instructions; strlen returns size_t on
		some systems
	cleared system breakpoint when simulator stops for any reason
		other than being interrupted by GUI, thus fixing bugs
		with breakpoint associated with the "next" command 
		surviving HALTs, user breakpoints, etc.

10 February 2004 (version 0.8)
	added missing quotes to MacOS-X Fink font overrides
	eliminated system breakpoints in favor of single address associated 
		with "next" command, thereby eliminating a couple of bugs: 
		(1) if the simulator was interrupted through interaction 
		with the GUI, such as setting/clearing breakpoints, during 
		a "next" operation, it lost track of where it was supposed 
		to stop; and
		(2) if the "clear all breakpoints" command was issued,
		the system breakpoint was erased (this bug was shadowed
		by the first)
	made the next and step commands correctly dump state after
		execution; delayed memory updates were not handled
		correctly for these commands
	made "Apply" button in options window pull font point size values
		from entry boxes before application of new options; the
		sizes were previously reset unless <Return> had been pressed
		in the entry box
	changed default code font for MacOS-X Fink installation to
		{LucidaTypewriter 11 normal}

9 February 2004 (version 0.7)
	set execution permission on lc3sim-tk during make
	allowed omission of "x" prefix when converting hexadecimal files
		with lc3convert
	fixed problems with CR-LF sequences in lc3as and lc3convert;
		both should now work (and were tested) with DOS-style
		end of line sequences
	added overrides for default fonts when installing for MacOS-X
		with Fink project's version of Tcl/Tk; new fonts
		suggested by Tevis Money, who also provided information
		on necessary paths, etc.

29 January 2004
	started to add support for MacOS, but found that two possible
		flavors exist (Fink and Aqua).  Fink needs some path
		additions and possibly default font changes, whereas
		Aqua apparently works with 0.6, and is available from 
		www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/tcltkaqua.html

22 January 2004 (version 0.6)
	fixed a minor bug involving use of scan command functionality
		not available with Tk8.2 (but available with 8.3), thus
		preventing use with older versions of wish

18 December 2003 (version 0.5)
	(just comments by SSL today)
	I've heard no bug reports on Linux to date (2-3 installations?)
	I don't think that GUI works properly on Solaris, but I haven't
		had time to do a serious testing job at work yet.
	I use Cygwin at home, so it should be reasonably stable 
		(assuming that they don't insert bugs or expose any of mine)
	so...I guess I'm going to release more broadly, but I'll keep the
		0.5 as a warning for now
	(send bug reports to lumetta@uiuc.edu with something clear in the
		subject line)

12 November 2003
	added code to change BR to BRnzp in assembler
	allowed colons after labels, in the style used in some examples
		in the second edition of Patt and Patel; the colon form
		also allows the opcode and pseudo-op names to be used
		as labels (provided that they are followed by a colon
		when defined)

31 October 2003 (version 0.4)
	fixed off-by-one error in scanf limits in simulator
	fixed misunderstood argument in tcsetattr calls
	set VMIN and VTIME appropriately (1 and 0, resp.) when LC-3 runs
	finished writing and included new lc3convert tool for conversion 
		from .bin and .hex files to .obj files

30 October 2003
	started development of lc3convert tool by paring down copy of lc3as
		lexer

29 October 2003 (version 0.3)
	removed remaining dependencies on gmake (use of $@ and $<)
	added delay watch cursor use when opening options window
		(since it can take a long time when many fonts are
		available)
	added delay watch when starting up (takes a long time to
		fill 64k lines on some older machines)
	fixed ^C handling for Solaris
	fixed bugs with use of readline (in both Makefile and lc3sim.c)

21 October 2003
	added option to read LC-3 console input from stdin (or GUI
		console) during script execution; turned ON by default

19 October 2003 (version 0.2: fixed some bugs, large and small)
	re-disassembled code for GUI after writing memory
	created option to delay updated code to GUI until LC-3 stops
		(on by default)
	added support to GUI to change delay option
	fixed retagging PC and breakpoints when values change
	made simulator indicate breakpoints and presence of PC in
		disassembly; simulator also indicates breakpoints now
	added display of '\a', '\b', and a few others
	fixed display of '{' and '}' (Tcl can't parse braces as lists)
	removed symbols from region of memory into which new code is loaded
		in simulator
	disallowed duplicate labels in assembler
	KNOWN ISSUE: may want to translate \a, \b, etc. when sent to console
		(console doesn't act like a VT-100)

18 October 2003 (version 0.1)
	software packaged for release to Austin
